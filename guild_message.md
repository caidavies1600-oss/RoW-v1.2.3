## 🏆 **Welcome to the RoW Event Bot!** 🏆

Hey everyone! Our Discord bot is here to make RoW event management super easy. Here's everything you need to know:

### 🎮 **Getting Started**
**Setting your IGN:** Use `!setign YourIGN` to set your in-game name
- This links your Discord to your RoW character
- **Not required but recommended** - if you don't set it, your Discord name will be used
- ⚠️ **If your Discord name doesn't match your in-game name, please set your IGN or you'll get smacked!**

### 📅 **How Events Work**
1. **Event Posted** (Tuesdays) - I'll post the weekly event with signup buttons
2. **Join Teams** - Click the blue buttons to join Main Team, Team 2, or Team 3
3. **Teams Lock** (Thursdays) - No more changes after this point
4. **Battle Day** - Show up and fight!

### 🔘 **Using the Signup Buttons**
- **🏆 Join Main Team** - **Competitive players only** (requires role)
- **🔸 Join Team 2** - Open to all skill levels  
- **🔸 Join Team 3** - Open to all skill levels  
- **🔴 Leave Team** - Remove yourself from your current team

**⚠️ Note:** If you see "Interaction Failed" when clicking buttons, don't worry! Your signup is still recorded properly. This is just a display glitch we're working on.

### 📋 **Useful Commands**
- `!events` - See current team signups
- `!myign` - Check your stored IGN
- `!mystats` - View your personal win/loss stats
