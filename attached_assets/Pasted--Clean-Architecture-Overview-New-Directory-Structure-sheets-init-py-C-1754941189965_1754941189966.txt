🧹 Clean Architecture Overview:
New Directory Structure:
sheets/
├── __init__.py                 # Clean export (SheetsManager only)
├── base_connection.py          # Authentication & connection layer
├── error_handler.py           # Centralized error handling & rate limiting
├── manager.py                 # Main SheetsManager class (entry point)
├── data_sync.py               # Data loading/syncing operations
├── template_creator.py        # Template creation (existing, updated)
├── worksheet_handlers.py      # Individual worksheet ops (existing, updated)
└── config.py                  # Sheet configurations (existing)
Key Improvements:

🗑️ Legacy Removal: Delete services/sheets_manager.py entirely
🔧 Modular Design: Each file has a specific responsibility
🔗 Clean Inheritance: SheetsManager → DataSync → BaseSheetsConnection + TemplateCreator
⚡ Better Error Handling: Centralized with rate limiting decorators
📊 Debug Tools: Enhanced debugging with !debugsheets command

Installation Steps:

Delete Legacy File:
bashrm services/sheets_manager.py

Create New Files: (from artifact above)

sheets/base_connection.py
sheets/error_handler.py
sheets/manager.py


Update Existing Files: (see artifact for details)

sheets/__init__.py
sheets/data_sync.py
sheets/template_creator.py
sheets/worksheet_handlers.py
utils/data_manager.py
bot/client.py


Add Debug Command:

Add !debugsheets to cogs/admin/owner_actions.py


Test Commands:
!debugsheets     # Shows "Clean Architecture" status
!sheetsinfo      # Tests connection
!fullsync        # Complete sync test
!syncmembers     # Member sync test


Benefits of Clean Architecture:

✅ No Code Duplication: Single source of truth in sheets/
✅ Better Error Handling: Centralized with proper rate limiting
✅ Easier Maintenance: Clear separation of concerns
✅ Robust Testing: Comprehensive debug tools
✅ Graceful Degradation: Works even if sheets fail

The new architecture eliminates the legacy system while maintaining all functionality. All imports now cleanly point to from sheets import SheetsManager and everything Just Works™.
